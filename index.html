        <p>I’m Aaron Cobbinah, a passionate graphic designer from Takoradi, Ghana, born on 16th July 1999. I completed my basic education at Believers International School in 2014, and continued my secondary education at Saint Augustine’s College, where I graduated in 2017. I later pursued higher education at GIMPA (Ghana Institute of Management and Public Administration) and successfully completed in 2021. My journey as a designer is driven by creativity, precision, and a strong desire to bring ideas to life through visuals.</p>
